Age Calculator using Python’s datetime Module

How It Works
The user enters their birth year.
The program fetches the current year automatically using datetime.
It calculates the age and the years left to turn 100.
The results are printed using formatted strings (f-strings).

 Example Output
Enter your birth year: 2005
You are 20 years old.
You will turn 100 in 80 years!
